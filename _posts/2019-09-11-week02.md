I learned contributing to open source projects is one of the effective ways a beginner coder can gain experience, develop and exercise his/her skill in real life situations, all the while contributing to  the betterment of widely used programs. The groups/ communities involved managing these open source projects have established rules and guidelines for contributions, particularly regarding writing and debugging of codes, with which newcomers are obliged learn, and conform to. It is for this reason above I’d like to start small with my contribution, by way of sharing ideas, suggesting inputs and giving feedback, and then work my way up from there.  

With regards to what projects I’m interested in doing, I did take some courses in geography, and urban and rural planning and I very much enjoyed it. Thus I found myself particularly interested in the OpenStreetMap project and would very much like to make my contributions in that field. It would be nice to develop a career in programming surrounding areas I already have some knowledge in.
In general though, I’d prefer whatever open-source project I involve myself in to be using C++ programming language as it’s the only programming language I have studied and I’m comfortable with thus far.
